        <p>Visual Studio is a software which is just like BRACKETS and CODEPEN and it is used for coding. It is set up by making a new folder on our device, making a new file, coding on it and then running it.</p>
        <p>The Console Screen is a small screen which can be seen by right clicking and inspecting. In this screen we can get all the output which we have inputed in our code. We can print anything on the Console Screen by just inputting a small command,'console.log();'</p>
